## üåü Project Overview

Welcome to the **Traffic Flow Prediction System** - an intelligent deep learning solution that harnesses the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast vehicle traffic patterns across multiple urban junctions. This project transforms historical traffic data into actionable insights for smart city planning and traffic management optimization.

### üéØ What This Project Does

- **Predicts Traffic Flow**: Uses advanced LSTM neural networks to forecast vehicle counts at traffic junctions
- **Multi-Junction Analysis**: Simultaneously analyzes and predicts traffic patterns for 4 different junctions
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Leverages sequential data patterns to make accurate future predictions
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides comprehensive metrics including MSE and MAE for model assessment
- **Visual Analytics**: Generates detailed plots for training progress and prediction accuracy

## üß† The Science Behind It

### Why LSTM Networks?

Traffic flow is inherently temporal - the number of vehicles at any junction depends heavily on historical patterns, daily routines, and sequential dependencies. Traditional machine learning models struggle with this temporal complexity, but LSTM networks excel at:

- **Memory Retention**: Remembering long-term traffic patterns (daily, weekly cycles)
- **Sequential Learning**: Understanding how traffic flow evolves over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying complex temporal relationships in traffic data

### Model Architecture

Our LSTM model features a sophisticated dual-layer architecture:

```
Input Layer (24 time steps) 
    ‚Üì
LSTM Layer 1 (64 units, return_sequences=True)
    ‚Üì
Dropout Layer (0.2) - Prevents overfitting
    ‚Üì
LSTM Layer 2 (64 units, return_sequences=False)
    ‚Üì
Dropout Layer (0.2)
    ‚Üì
Dense Layer (25 units)
    ‚Üì
Output Layer (1 unit) - Vehicle count prediction
```

## üìä Dataset Structure

The model works with traffic data containing:
- **DateTime**: Timestamp of traffic measurement
- **Junction**: Junction identifier (1-4)
- **Vehicles**: Number of vehicles recorded
- **ID**: Unique record identifier

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Temporal Indexing**: DateTime conversion and indexing for time series analysis
2. **Normalization**: MinMaxScaler transformation (0-1 range) for optimal neural network performance
3. **Sequence Creation**: 24-hour lookback windows for pattern recognition
4. **Train-Test Split**: 80-20 split ensuring temporal integrity

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

### Usage

```python
python traffic_flow_prediction.py
```

The script will automatically:
1. Load and preprocess your traffic data
2. Train individual LSTM models for each junction
3. Generate predictions and performance metrics
4. Display comprehensive visualizations
